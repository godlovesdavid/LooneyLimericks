LooneyLimericks
===============


This is a basic PHP website for my Server-Side Web Programming course, which allows users to input loony poems and have them be rated by other users. Features:

-REST (buttons query server for pages by URL, like newest or highest rated poems page).
-MVC (when querying for pages, controller makes model which then creates requested view)
-rating system (by an open source project I can't find anymore) in jquery, rating 1-5 stars with GUI
-CSS for colors and other stylings
-JS for forms and checking
-PHP for JS form data reception, authentication, view renders, etc.
